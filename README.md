# Unsupervised Segmentation Using Convolutional Neural Network

This is an implementation of my paper:

<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.10155">Chen, Junyu, et al. "An Unsupervise Learning Model for Medical Imaging Segmentation. " arXiv preprints, arXiv, 2020.</a>

We tested our loss on the task of bone segmentation in simulated bone SPECT images.
